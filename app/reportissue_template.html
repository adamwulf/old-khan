        Otherwise, please use the following steps to create a new issue in our issue tracking system.&nbsp;
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the 
	        {% block new_issue_link %}<a href="http://code.google.com/p/khanacademy/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20from%20user&labels=Referer-{{referer|urlencode}},Type-Defect,{{issues_label|urlencode}}">new problem form</a>{% endblock new_issue_link %}.&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>Fill in the <b>Summary</b> and <b>Description</b> fields.&nbsp;   <span style="color: red;"/>Note: The information you provide will become public, so do not include any private or confidential information.</span></li>
		<li>Click the <b>Submit Issue</b> button.</li>
	</ol>  
        Your submission will show up in the list once we've had a chance to give it a quick review.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>If you vote for something or submit something new, you'll get emails as people comment on it.&nbsp;
        When we think we've taken care of it you'll get an email saying "Status: Fixed", and you'll see the difference 
        the next time we upgrade the site.&nbsp;  If at any point you want to stop getting the emails, just follow the
        link in one of them and click on the star to make it dim.&nbsp;
